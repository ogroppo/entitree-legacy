## WARNING: The development has moved to https://github.com/codeledge/entitree-next

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app can be served from a node.js (express) server, which is only useful for Server-side rendering.

Live website here https://www.entitree.com/

Test website here https://entitree-test.herokuapp.com/

![Interface example](https://github.com/ogroppo/entitree/blob/main/public/examples/interface.png)

## User instructions

Search for items (people, organizations, anything!) from the top search bar and then select a property from the dropdown.
Language can be changed from the top right 'settings' button.

## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ogroppo/entitree
cd entitree/
npm install
```

## Run with server

If you want the app served by node.js do:

```
npm run build
npm start
```

Open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)

## Run with CRA's dev server (hot reload & stuff)

```
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

This has been added to support featured images, however it is possible to run the app locally without running the server but only react under port 3000
